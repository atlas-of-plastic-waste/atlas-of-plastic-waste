# Atlas of Plastic Waste 
An expanding public database of plastic and other waste dumps throughout the world. The apw shapefile contains polygons for a large number of crowdsourced dumpsites between 2016 and 2021. This is a work in progress and will continue to expand.

Description:

This repository contains a shapefile of open aggregations of plastic waste between 2016 and 2021. Polygons were drawn using Google Earth historical imagery based on submissions from individuals and other publicly available data sources (see below). A 'dump' is defined as a location where plastic waste is visible on the earth's surface. Thus the polygons include both informal dumps, and formal landfills, though in the latter case the polygon may only contain the open 'working face' of the landfill. However the location of the working face may vary over the course of the year. The polygons are based on the clearest image closest to the midpoint of the year.
